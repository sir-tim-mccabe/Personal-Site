                <h1>Hi! I'm Tim</h1>
                <p>I am a third-year student pursuing a BS in Computer Science at the University of Cincinnati, where I am also the
                    Google Cloud Platform Student Innovator. I am passionate about back-end development, math (which I'm pursuing a
                    minor in!), and physics/simulation, but first and foremost I love any new programming challenge. If I'm not
                    programming or setting up GCP events, I'm probably singing and playing guitar or playing video games on really
                    old computer monitors.</p>

                            <p>I worked with an international team centered in Italy on an internal site called Solutionlink. It
                                is built in AngularJS with a C# back end. I was responsible for testing, fixing bugs, updating
                                automated tests, and modernizing the user interface of many pages. I also trained a member of a
                                team in India on how to use and continue development on my automated testing project from my first
                                semester.</p>
                            <p>I learned how to use AngularJS to build the front end of a full-stack application. This changed my
                                perspective on web development, as I had never used a framework before and had not seen how much
                                they can improve structure and code reuse. Additionally, I learned how to communicate with an
                                international team via Skype. Having to schedule around a time difference and communicate entirely
                                digitally was a challenge, but it was a great opportunity for me to develop my communication and
                                organization skills.</p>

                            <p>My team of five co-ops developed an automated testing solution. It includes a Chrome extension that
                                records actions, a Java program that executed the recorded actions, and a Node.js/Express server
                                that stores and displays test results and analyses screenshots. My main responsibilities developing
                                a large portion of the server and creating a new user interface for the Chrome extension.</p>
                            <p>I learned how to create and structure a server in Node.js with a RESTful API, and that experience now
                                drives my passion for back-end development. I also learned how to work on a large preexisting project
                                with multiple team members&mdash;before this, all of my experience had been working on small projects I
                                made by myself or with a few friends.</p>

                        <h5>Technologies: MATLAB, JavaScript, HTML5</h5>
                        <p>I worked with a group of three other students to produce an accurate simulation of air resistance and lift
                            forces and deploy it online. We created a golf video game with accurate physics that implements Euler's
                            method to simulate the flight, bouncing, and rolling of a golf ball on flat turf. The source code can be
                            found <a href="https://github.com/ModelsHonorsExp/ModelsHonorsExp.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>You can try the game out <a href="https://modelshonorsexp.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>! The left
                            view is a projection of the game from the side, and the right side is a top-down view. You can choose your
                            club with the dropdown menu, and you can turn left and right using the arrow keys or the buttons. Tap or
                            click once to set the vertical angle, then again to set the power.</p>

                        <h5>Technologies: Python, Lua</h5>
                        <p>I created this project as a way to learn the fundamentals of neural networks and genetic algorithms while
                            incorporating another one of my passions&mdash;retro video games. I researched the memory layout of Super Mario
                            Kart and wrote a Lua script to extract the relevant data. Then I wrote a neural network in Python to receive
                            data from the Lua script, determine what buttons to press, and send that data back to the emulator. The
                            Python script also handled the scoring and generations of networks. The source code can be found
